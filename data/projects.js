    "abstract": "Although the rise of online application platforms has facilitated the submission of CVs, the process of selecting candidates for doctoral programs remains a time and resource-intensive task. It is therefore necessary to develop models to automate the matching between candidate profiles and program requirements. Recent studies have focused on using deep learning techniques to model this matching process. However, these models often suffer from a lack of interpretability due to the complex transformations they perform. Yet, in a real-world context, it is crucial to explain why a candidate is selected or rejected. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach that leverages machine learning techniques while ensuring the readability of the results. This is achieved by extracting relevant features from CVs and cover letters and using them for classification and prediction tasks. Results obtained on a dataset of 651 resumes from the University Chouaib Doukkali in the El Jadida region, Morocco, show an accuracy of 77% for classification, confirming the ability of our system to identify promising candidates.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces an innovative dual-model deep learning framework for the automated detection and segmentation of brain lesions in MRI images, aiming to address key challenges in medical imaging through the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced computational methods. The proposed system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG architecture for lesion detection and classification, achieving an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores of 95% and 94%, respectively. For segmentation, a UNet-ResNeXt50 model using a hybrid loss function (combining Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy) delivers precise delineation of lesion boundaries, with a Dice Coefficient of 0.92 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.88. Trained on a large dataset—over 10,000 MRI images for detection and annotated scans from more than 100 patients for segmentation—the framework demonstrates strong robustness and generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. The integration of data augmentation techniques and the hybrid loss function allows the model to effectively manage data variability and class imbalance, making it well-suited for embedded computing applications in resource-constrained medical environments.",

This project introduces a multilingual medical dialogue system that combines natural language processing (NLP) with multimodal interaction capabilities, textual and vocal to enhance user engagement and promote equitable access to primary health guidance. Developed using the Streamlit framework, the proposed system harnesses the power of advanced transformer-based architectures, notably BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), to perform zero-shot symptom classification. It enables accurate interpretation of free-text symptom descriptions and delivers context-aware responses in seven languages, including English, French, Arabic, Spanish, Italian, German and Portuguese. This linguistic versatility is further augmented by integrated automatic language detection, speech-to-text recognition, and text-to-speech synthesis, thereby ensuring seamless interaction for users with visual impairments or limited literacy. The model is trained on expert-labeled data including symptoms, demographics, and conditions to generate personalized diagnostic suggestions. A key feature is its geolocation-based engine, which recommends nearby healthcare services with practical details, like names, adresses, contact details and estimated distances, making support both personalized and location-specific. This research highlights how multilingual conversational AI can help overcome language, accessibility, and diagnostic challenges, showing its potential to improve early symptom screening, promote health literacy, and make healthcare more inclusive and globally accessible.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to expert radiological interpretation is scarce. While chest X-rays (CXRs) serve as the primary diagnostic tool, their manual interpretation suffers from inter-observer variability and diagnostic delays, necessitating automated solutions. This study presents a deep learning system for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. We developed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on 5,863 chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset, incorporating batch normalization, dropout regularization, and data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization. To improve model interpretability, we integrated Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for visual explanations and implemented an automated report generation system. The proposed model achieved 87.8% accuracy, 89.9% precision, 86.1% recall, and 94.9% specificity on the test set, with Grad-CAM visualizations successfully highlighting clinically relevant regions as validated by radiologist Dr. Amina Alaoui. The system was deployed as a web-based application using Flask, enabling real time diagnosis. This work demonstrates the successful integration of deep learning techniques for pneumonia detection, offering an efficient and clinically viable solution that enhances diagnostic capabilities in resource-constrained environments.",
